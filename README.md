# Concrete_Compressive_Strength
In this project i will build a machine learning model cabable of predicting the concrete compressive strength based on some features.
# Used Libraries
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- ScikitLearn
- Warnings
# Used Models
- LinearRegression
- Lasso
# Used Metrics
- R2 Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
# The Best Algorithm
The best model in this project was lasso model. I used lasso for regularization, i applied with this model polynomial features and data scaling.
#### The model evaluation:
- Training Score:  0.9999991086809153
- Testing Score:  0.9999990934090051
- MSE: 0.00023878182906220092
- MAE: 0.011375983457917085
